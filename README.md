# Mission_RND

This was a program where we had to code and learn the **intricate details of C and C++**, with the implementation of various 
data Structures like Arrays to Graphs.

In this we have also explored the **Pthread Library** and thread concepts and the Memory concepts where we have **implemented the
Memory Allocation** and Deallocation Algorithms.

**Self implemented DBMS** with File concept using C.

It was fun.
